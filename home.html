      <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
      <h2>Q: When should I sell?</h2>
      <h4>A: There are many reasons to sell an investment you already own. The most common reason we sell our investments is because they have become over (or fairly) valued.</h4>

      <h2>Q: How much money should I spend on each investment?</h2>
      <h4>A: Minimize the proportion of the investment funds eroded by taxes and fees. To this end, we chose to take positions that are sizable relative to the transaction costs.</h4>

      <h2>Q: How long should I hold an investment?</h2>
      <h4>A: When possible we hold stocks for longer than one year, preferably many years, so as to avoid short term capital gains taxes, and excess work. It may be the case than an investment becomes risky through price appreciation such that selling early is indicated.</h4>

      <h2>Q: What do I do if a stock I own goes down in price?</h2>
      <h4>A: We spend a lot of time understanding whether a company is undervalued and a lot more time understanding whether the company will remain in a position to produce excess cash well into the future. Once we are convinced that a company is worth more than the market price then it only makes sense to either hold the stock or buy more when the price goes down. Quite simply this is because the investment has become less risky.</h4>

      <h2>Q: Why should I buy individual stocks instead of index funds?</h2>
      <h4>A: Index funds are great, but diversified risk implies diversified returns. We find that patience combined with a long-term value based portfolio strategy can be a good supplement to an already diversified portfolio.</h4>
